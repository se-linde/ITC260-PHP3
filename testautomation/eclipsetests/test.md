These tests work in Eclipse with Selenium and Webdriver. The tests themselves run in JUnit 4, which is a testing harnass

This was the document I followed, to get Eclipse, Selenium, and WebDriver going:
"https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/826914/How-to-Setup-and-Configure-Selenium-Webdriver-With".

Again, these tests themselves are written in Java.
