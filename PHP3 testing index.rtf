\f0\fs36 \cf0 PHP 3 TESTING INDEX: 
\fs24 \
\
In my PHP 3 class, I was solely responsible for all of the testing, both manual and automated, for our group application. The application is called Gig Central, which is written in JavaScript, PHP, HTML, and CSS; the goal of the application is to connect job seekers with open positions. \
\
In this document, I will be listing the location of my hosting of the application, as well as the test documents that I wrote for this class. \
\
Here is the location of all of my automation that I wrote; it is all in Java, and run through Selenium and Web Driver: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/se-linde/ITC260-PHP3/tree/master/testautomation"}}{\fldrslt https://github.com/se-linde/ITC260-PHP3/tree/master/testautomation}}\
\
Here is the location of the Master Test Plan I wrote, for the class project. It includes test goals, scope, test hurdles, and plans for future testing: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n2HKfRUb9CVXGhrK6bqsZgD0h8XnY6sZXbqpC2BJe3M/edit"}}{\fldrslt https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n2HKfRUb9CVXGhrK6bqsZgD0h8XnY6sZXbqpC2BJe3M/edit}}\
\
Here is a copy of the manual test cases that I wrote for the project: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQ9QtgKyZMwEraqeHw-4xqHUtWjVCpQiAWsw9QGVvvI/edit#gid=1"}}{\fldrslt https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQ9QtgKyZMwEraqeHw-4xqHUtWjVCpQiAWsw9QGVvvI/edit#gid=1}}\
\
And here is a copy of the Testing Handoff document I wrote, for the next class: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zgb_EMvRGLDQNh5W3bG9U0xsQ1Xdgmwe_vU0wrnVmhE/edit"}}{\fldrslt https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zgb_EMvRGLDQNh5W3bG9U0xsQ1Xdgmwe_vU0wrnVmhE/edit}}\
\
Overall, I enjoyed working on these projects for class, and would love to continue to work in this realm, in a professional setting. \
